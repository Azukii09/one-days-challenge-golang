Problem day 4 - 8 mei 2024

In this Go challenge, you are going to be implementing a function that takes in two string values and checks to see if they are permutations of one another.

Example
If I have 2 strings, “abc” and “cba”, when I pass these strings into the function, it should return true as these two strings are permutations of each other.

How can we optimize this function so that it is not performing unnecessary calculations?
A. We can check the length of each string at the start of the function and return false if they differ
B. We can use maps to efficiently lookup previously encountered characters
C. All of the Above
