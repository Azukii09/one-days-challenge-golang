Problem day 8 - 12 mei 2024

In this challenge, you are tasked with trying to implement a function that checks to see if a set is a sub-set of another set.

Weâ€™ll be carrying on the flying theme where the function takes in a slice of Flights and then checks to see if they exist within another slice of flights.

Hint
There are a number of ways to solve this. You may be able to use the reflect package or you may be able to serialize each flight and create a hash of them which you can store in a hash.
